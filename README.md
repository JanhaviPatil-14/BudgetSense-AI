Turning India’s Union Budget Into Economic Intelligence

---

## 📌 **Project Mission**

India’s Union Budget is a massive policy document filled with complex narratives, sectoral priorities, reforms, and financial allocations. Extracting insights manually is slow and error-prone.

**BudgetSense-AI transforms the Union Budget into structured, AI-powered economic intelligence**, enabling analysts, students, and researchers to discover:

* Which sectors receive the highest focus?
* What policies dominate the speech?
* How do financial allocations vary across ministries?
* What economic patterns can be forecasted using AI?
* How can automation accelerate policy analysis?

This project combines **NLP + ML + data engineering** to bring clarity to India’s most important financial document.

# 🔍 **Insight Highlights**

## 🧠 **Text Analysis Module — *Completed***

### 📄 Data Extracted

✔ Full budget speech parsed into clean, structured text
✔ 800+ sentences processed for NLP analysis

### 🏷️ Entity Detection

✔ Ministries (Finance, Health, Education, etc.)
✔ Schemes & missions (e.g., Krishi, Digital India initiatives)
✔ Financial amounts (standardized to ₹ crore)
✔ Percentages (growth, allocations, fiscal targets)

### 🎯 Key Themes Identified

✔ Infrastructure Development
✔ Agriculture & Rural Economy
✔ Digital Innovation & Startups
✔ Social Welfare & Education

### 📊 Early Insights Generated

✔ Funding patterns recognized
✔ Scheme references extracted
✔ Wordclouds & keyword clusters created
✔ Structured datasets ready for machine learning

This module forms the **core intelligence engine** of BudgetSense-AI.

## 💬 **Sentiment Analysis Module — *Upcoming***

### 🔎 Purpose

To analyze how the public and media respond to major fiscal policies in the budget.

### Planned Capabilities

* Classify reactions as **Positive / Negative / Neutral**
* Analyze news and social media commentary
* Combine sentiment with policy sectors
* Map emotional patterns across key reforms

### What It Will Help Reveal

* Which announcements are well received?
* What concerns are raised by the public or analysts?
* How sentiment trends change across budget sections?

Sentiment analysis will add a **behavioral understanding** to the economic document.

## 🔮 **Forecasting Module — *Upcoming***

### 🎯 Purpose

Predict future economic trends using multi-year government budget data.

### Planned Features

* Regression & Time-Series models for allocations
* Ministry-level expenditure forecasts
* Growth projections for key sectors
* Comparative analysis across financial years

### Expected Outputs

* Predicted sector growth charts
* Forecasted budget allocations
* Multi-year trendlines

This module will add **predictive intelligence** to the system.
